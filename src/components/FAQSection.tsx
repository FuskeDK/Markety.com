    question: "What exactly does Markety do?",
    answer:
      "We run your full lead generation system. Email marketing, landing pages, funnel structure, and ad management. You give us access to your accounts and we handle everything. Your sales team just shows up to conversations with people who are already interested.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "Our pricing is based on the leads we deliver. Not a fixed monthly fee regardless of results. Before we start, we agree on what a qualified lead looks like for your business, and that's what you pay for.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I see results?",
    answer:
      "Most clients start receiving leads within the first 2 weeks. The first few days are spent setting up your campaigns, landing pages, and email flows. After that, we go live and start optimizing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to do anything myself?",
    answer:
      "Very little. We need access to your ad accounts and about 30 minutes to understand your business and what a good lead looks like for you. After that, we take care of everything. You just talk to the leads we send your way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the leads aren't good quality?",
    answer:
      "We define exactly what counts as a qualified lead with you before we start. If a lead doesn't meet that standard, it doesn't count. We're motivated to send you people who are actually ready to buy. That's how we get paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I stop working with you at any time?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We don't lock you into long term contracts. If things aren't working, you can walk away. We'd rather earn your business every month than hold you to a 12 month deal.",
  },
